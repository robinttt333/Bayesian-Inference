# Bayesian-Inference
This is a simple example of Baysian Inference that takes the example of coin toss.  
The prior and is a Beta distribution and has initial values of alpha and beta set equal to 1.  
As we take more and more samples we can clearly see that the distribution converges to 0.5 ie the true probability of getting a heads or tails if a fair coin is used.
